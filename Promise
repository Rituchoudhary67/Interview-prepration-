what is Promise?

Promise ia an object representing the eventual completition or failure of an asynchronous operation.

//when promises was not there we use call back but when there are so many call back then it becomes call back hell
//example of before promises how we write asynchronos code using call back

const cart = ["a","b","c"];
createOrder(cart, function (orderId) {
  procedToPayment(orderId);
})


//by using promise
const cart = ["panipuri","Tari poha"]

const myPromise = createOrder(cark);
myPromise.then(function (orderId) {
  procedToPayment(orderId)
})
