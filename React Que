//React interview question....
1. What is React ?
   A JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces
   Its aim is to allow developers to easily create fast user interfaces for websites and applications 

2. Features of React ?
   JSX -JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
        JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
        JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
   Components-Components are independent and they are reusable bits of code.
              Components are of two types, Class components and Function components
              Class Components:
              A class component must include the extends React.Component statement.
              The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.
              Ex:- class Car extends React.Component {
                   render() {
                              return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                             }
                   }
              Function Components:
              Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand
              Ex:- function Car() {
                     return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                   }
   One-way Data Binding- it describes a one-way data flow where the data flows from the parent to the child component, it is known as
                         the unidirectional flow of data.
