//React interview question....
1. What is React ?
   A JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces
   Its aim is to allow developers to easily create fast user interfaces for websites and applications 

2. Features of React ?
   JSX -JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
        JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
        JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
        
   Components-Components are independent and they are reusable bits of code.
              Components are of two types, Class components and Function components
              Class Components:
              A class component must include the extends React.Component statement.
              The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.
              Ex:- class Car extends React.Component {
                   render() {
                              return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                             }
                   }
              Function Components:
              Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand
              Ex:- function Car() {
                     return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                   }
                   
   One-way Data Binding- it describes a one-way data flow where the data flows from the parent to the child component, it is known as
                         the unidirectional flow of data.
                         
   Virtual DOM- The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory
                and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
                the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with React elements 
               
   Simplicity- ReactJS uses JSX file which makes the application simple and to code as well as understand
               ReactJS is a component-based approach which makes the code reusable as your need. This makes it simple to use and learn.

38. Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?
    No, they are different. The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components.
    The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.
