//React interview question....
1. What is React ?
   A JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces
   Its aim is to allow developers to easily create fast user interfaces for websites and applications 

2. Features of React ?
   JSX -JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
        JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
        JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
        
   Components-Components are independent and they are reusable bits of code.
              Components are of two types, Class components and Function components
              Class Components:
              A class component must include the extends React.Component statement.
              The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.
              Ex:- class Car extends React.Component {
                   render() {
                              return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                             }
                   }
              Function Components:
              Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand
              Ex:- function Car() {
                     return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                   }
                   
   One-way Data Binding- it describes a one-way data flow where the data flows from the parent to the child component, it is known as
                         the unidirectional flow of data.
                         
   Virtual DOM- The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory
                and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
                the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with React elements 
               
   Simplicity- ReactJS uses JSX file which makes the application simple and to code as well as understand
               ReactJS is a component-based approach which makes the code reusable as your need. This makes it simple to use and learn.           
  
   Performance-React allows us to measure the performance of our apps using the Profiler in the React DevTools. 

3. Unidirectional flow in React ?
   It is nothing but One-way Data Binding that describes a one-way data flow where the data flows from the parent to the child component, it is known as
   this is known as unidirectional flow of data.
   
4. What is Virtual DOM ?
   The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory
   and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
   the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with React elements 

5. Explain how Virtual DOM works ?--don't know ////

6. Difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM ?
   see the half ans is above
   Real DOM                                                          Virtual DOM
   DOM manipulation is very expensive                                DOM manipulation is very easy
   There is too much memory wastage                                  No memory wastage
   
7. What is JSX ?
   JSX -JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
        JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
        JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
        
8. How does browser understand JSX ?
   As JSX is combination of HTML and JavaScript it is not supported by Browsers. So, if any 
   file contains JSX file, Babeltranspiler converts the JSX into JavaScript objects
   which becomes a valid JavaScript. Thus, browsers understands the code and executes.
   
9. What is babel ?
   Babel is a JavaScript compiler, which is used for converting ECMAScript code to browser understandable code
   
10. Explain useState hook ?
    The useState hook is a special function that takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array of two entries. 
    Ex:- import { useState } from "react";
         function FavoriteColor() {
            const [color, setColor] = useState("");
         }
         
11. What are statefull and stateless components ?
    In React, a stateful component is a component that holds some state. Stateless components, by contrast, have no state.
    Note that both types of components can use props.
    
12. What is a key in React ?
    A “key” is a special string attribute that we need to include when creating lists of elements in React.
    Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. 
    we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists
    
13. Why key is it necessary ?
    Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
    
14. In what cases we should not use array index as key ?
    In cases where the array is sorted or an element is added to the beginning of the array, the index will be changed even though
    the element representing that index may be the same. This results in unnecessary renders.
    
15. Why should we not use array index as key ?
    It is not recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively
    impact performance and may cause issues with component state.

16. What are synthetic events ?
    Synthetic events are that ReactJS reuses these events objects, by pooling them, which increase the performance
    the synthetic events are onClick(), onBlur() and onChange(). 
    
17. What are controlled components ?
    In React, Controlled Components are those in which form's data is handled by the component's state. It takes
    its current value through props and makes changes through callbacks like onClick,onChange, etc.
    Ex- 
18. What are uncontrolled components ?
19. What is the difference between the two ?
20. What are props in react ?
21. What is the difference between props and state in react ?
22. What are the differenct lifecycle methods ?
23. What are side effects in react ? 
24. What is the useEffect hook ?
25. How can we use useEffect hook to implement the lifecycle methods ?
26. What is useRef hook ?
27. Explain some use cases for useRef hook ?
28. What are Higher Order Components ?
29. What is a Pure component ?
30. What is prop drilling ?
31. How can we solve the problem of prop drilling ?
31. What is Context API ? How it can be used to solve prop drilling ?
32. What are error boundaries ?
33. useCallback hook 
34. useMemo hook
35. Difference between the two
36. What is React.memo ?
37. State management 
38. Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?
    No, they are different. The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components.
    The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.
